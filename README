dsge
====
A simple Python (2.7) package for Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) models.

This was originally forked from Pablo Winant's (excellent) package
dolo.  (See [https://github.com/EconForge/dolo].)  I wrote this mainly
for my own personal use; as such it may contain bugs, and the
documentation might be lacking in some (many) places.

Installation
------------
For linux/mac users, at the command line type:

``pip install http://dsge.edherbst.net/dist/dsge-0.0.2.tar.gz``

For windows users, use

``pip install http://dsge.edherbst.net/dist/dsge-0.0.2.zip``


Bugs and Questions
------------------
For bug reports and questions, send me an email at
edward.p.herbst@frb.gov.  If there is enough interest,
I'll mirror the source on github.
